# [JUMBOTRON](https://jumbotron-rss.herokuapp.com/)

Jumbotron parses RSS-XML files to create a podcast web application with no ads.

Things I would like to add:
+ Front-end betterness
+ Check for new episodes (daily?)
+ Users
+ Logins
 + Only show podcasts for the current user
 + Track which episodes have been completed
 + Track episode progress between sessions
+ The ability to add more podcasts
 + Find a podcast list
