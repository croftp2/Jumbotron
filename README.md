# [JUMBOTRON](https://jumbotron-rss.herokuapp.com/)

Jumbotron parses RSS-XML files to create a podcast web application with no ads.

Things I would like to add:
- Front-end betterness
- Check for new episodes (daily?)
- Users
-- Logins
-- Only show podcasts for the current user
-- Track which episodes have been completed
-- Track episode progress between sessions
- The ability to add more podcasts
-- Find a podcast list
